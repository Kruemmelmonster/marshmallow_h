Layers
------

    1. Platform

    The platform layer manages the different platform dependent
    components and makes them available in a unified way to both the
    logic and view.

    2. Logic

    Game logic layer is the base for the actual game it self. It must be
    absolutely platform independent.

    3. View

    The game view layer is in charge of interpreting the game logic in
    some form or another, be it a GUI, events to an AI or a network
    proxy.
