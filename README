Marshmallow Engine
==================

  This engine concept is still flaky. :)

  It's all one big TODO

Building
========

Linux
-----

Run the following from project root:

    ./configure && make -C build

Mac OSX
-------

Run the following from project root:

    ./configure -G Xcode

    Launch Xcode and open the project file in the build directory.

Windows
-------

    Run CMakeGui with `source` set to project root and `output` to the build
    directory.

    Configure and Generate a MSVC++ 2010 solution.
    (I've only tested it on Windows 7 with MSVC++ 2010).

    MinGW also works.
