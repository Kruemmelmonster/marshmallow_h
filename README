            “The only game engine that tastes better slightly burned!”

About
=====

Marshmallow is a game engine for 8-bit and 16-bit style 2D video games, it won’t
be limited to such, but most of the base features will focus on that era of
gaming.

Source
======

    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/gamaral/marshmallow_h.git

    Notice the *--recursive* switch, it's needed so that submodules get checked
    out along with the main repository.

Building
========

Linux
-----

Run the following from project root:

    ./configure && make -C build

    X11-GLX is turned OFF by default, you will need to turn it ON using
    ccmake/cmake-gui or by passing the following argument to the configuration
    script: -DMARSHMALLOW_VIEWPORT_USE_X11_GLX:BOOL=ON (remember to reconfigure
    more than one to allow cmake to look for dependencies)

Mac OSX
-------

Run the following from project root:

    ./configure -G Xcode

    Launch Xcode and open the project file in the build directory.

Windows
-------

    Run CMakeGui with `source` set to project root and `output` to the build
    directory. Make sure to run the configure step at least twice after changing the backend
    or you might get issues with libpng not being found.

    X11-WGL (wiggle) is turned OFF by default, you will need to turn it ON using
    ccmake/cmake-gui.

    Configure and Generate a VS 2008/2010 solution, or generate makefiles to build
    from the command line using nmake or jom (https://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/jom)

    MinGW also works.

    Tested platforms are Win7 x86/x64
