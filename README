                             Marshmallow Game Engine
====================================================================================
            “The only game engine that tastes better slightly burned!”

About
=====

Marshmallow is a game engine for 8-bit and 16-bit style 2D video games, it won’t
be limited to such, but most of the base features will focus on that era of
gaming.

Source
======

    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/gamaral/marshmallow_h.git

    Notice the *--recursive* switch, it's needed so that submodules get checked
    out along with the main repository.

Building
========

    I include many predefined cmake configurations, please take a look at the
    "cmake" folder in the project root, filenames are pretty self-explanatory.

Linux/BSD
---------

Run the following from project root:

    cd build
    cmake -C ../cmake/Cache-release_glx.cmake ..
    make

    Marshmallow's go-to compiler is Clang, the example above uses gcc since it's
    almost guaranteed to be on the system (unlike Clang).

Mac OSX
-------

Run the following from project root:

    cd build
    cmake -G Xcode -C ../cmake/Cache-release_qt4.cmake ..
    make

    Launch Xcode and open the project file in the build directory, CGL is
    currently unsupported (due to my lazyness, so SDL and QT4 can be used for
    now).

Windows
-------

    Run CMakeGui with `source` set to project root and `output` to the build
    directory. Make sure to run the configure step at least twice after changing
    the backend or you might get issues with libpng not being found.

    The OpenGL backend and WGL viewport are turned off by default, you will
    need to turn it ON using ccmake/cmake-gui.

    Configure and Generate a VS 2008/2010 solution, or generate makefiles to build
    from the command line using nmake or jom (https://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/jom)

    Tested on Win7 x86/x64 (VS2010)
