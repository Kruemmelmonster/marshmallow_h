Marshmallow Engine
==================

  IMAGINE AN UNDER CONSTRUCTION GIF HERE. :)

  -> Currently only Linux and Mac OSX (X11-GLX viewport) are working.

  * Should be pretty easy to get SDL viewport working on both Mac OSX and Wimp Lo
    while I work on WGL and CGL.

Building
========

Linux
-----

Run the following from project root:

    ./configure && make -C build

    X11-XGL is turned OFF by default, you will need to turn it ON using
    ccmake/cmake-gui or by passing the following argument to the configuration
    script: -DMARSHMALLOW_VIEWPORT_USE_X11_GLX:BOOL=ON (remember to reconfigure
    more than one to allow cmake to look for dependencies)

Mac OSX
-------

Run the following from project root:

    ./configure -G Xcode

    Launch Xcode and open the project file in the build directory.

Windows
-------

    Run CMakeGui with `source` set to project root and `output` to the build
    directory.

    X11-WGL (wiggle) is turned OFF by default, you will need to turn it ON using
    ccmake/cmake-gui.

    Configure and Generate a MSVC++ 2010 solution.
    (I've only tested it on Windows 7 with MSVC++ 2010).

    MinGW also works.
